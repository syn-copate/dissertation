While there are tree-sitter implementations available for this syntax, the contributor requires guidance on integrating them into the package to prepare a Pull Request effectively. This Pull Request aims to address the lack of documentation and provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to add new languages to the aider repo-maps. \n\n### Proposed Changes:\n- Document the process of adding new languages to the aider repo-maps, specifically focusing on integrating tree-sitter implementations for Clojure syntax.\n- Provide clear instructions and examples to help contributors like the one raising the issue successfully add support for new languages.\n\n### How to Test:\n- Follow the documented steps to add Clojure support.\n- Verify that the new language is correctly integrated and functioning as expected within the aider repo-maps.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nAny feedback and suggestions are welcome to refine the documentation and make the process of adding new languages more accessible and intuitive for future contributors. \n\nPlease review and provide feedback on this proposed resolution.",

Oops :) tree-sitter-languages-freed-wu-pr is a microfork I made based on https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/pull/53 . It does not change the API or build behavior, it just adds new languages (at least on Linux/MacOS, I couldn't get the Windows linker to work with the full list). This change is smaller, but #8 has more hope of support. So this is intended as a band-aid.",

Key changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Greatly increases the number of supported languages, including Swift and Svelte.\r\n2. Resolves dependency on an unmaintained package that was forcing grep-ast to use an old tree-sitter version (0.21).\r\n3. Unlocks the ability to use more recent tree-sitter versions.\r\n4. Updates requirements.txt to use tree-sitter-language-pack>=0.2.0.\r\n5. Increments the version number to 0.3.4-dev in setup.py.\r\n6. Adds extensive test cases for parsing various languages in test_parsers.py.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n- Removed support for DOT, OCaml, ql (GitHub CodeQL), and tsq (Tree Sitter Query) due to their absence in the new pack.\r\n- Removed potentially incorrect mappings for .gomod, .sqlite, and .regex extensions.\r\n- Replaced the uncommon \".et\" mapping for \"embeddedtemplate\" with mappings for ERB and EJS, which are common uses of embedded templates.\r\n- Re-enabled markdown as the new pack uses to a different markdown grammar that likely doesn't suffer from previous bugs.",

It is possible currently to get around the build issues for py-tree-sitter-languages by pinning `tree-sitter` to version 0.21.x and explicitly including distutils in the package. But having this whole tree depend on a maintained package would be better, overall, rather than requiring introduction of an abandoned package into a new tool. That workaround probably will not last forever, so it would be fantastic to have a version of grep-ast that did not require the older/abandoned dependencies.",

But most people who are consuming this outside of a `pip install` are going to use their system libraries. `py-tree-sitter-languages` is incompatible with `tree-sitter` 0.22+ which most Linux distributions have moved to because of its improved support for Python 3.12 and because it's the latest. And, since tree-sitter-languages is abandonware, it will not likely ever be updated. It would be better for anyone consuming this if an updated dependency was leveraged, instead. The issue isn't the transitive dep on tree-sitter itself. It's the dependency on tree-sitter-languages which has been abandoned and therefore doesn't support a pip install nor have good support in packaging distributions.",

I'm also aware of the other issues you mentioned, and I'm very much interested in us building a successor package that is both future-compatible and smaller than `tree-sitter-language-pack`.

For me, the size and build time, despite being substantial, aren't all that significant compared to the benefits. But, I'm sure we can (and should) do better:\r\n\r\n@Goldziher I see that the published files on [pypi.org/tree-sitter-language-pack](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-language-pack/#files) don't include any wheels, but that you've worked on some infrastructure to [build and publish](https://github.com/Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_and_publish.yaml) wheels. This seems like it'd be a non-trivial undertaking. Can you comment on the status/challenges of that work?\r\n\r\n@paul-gauthier If tree-sitter-language-pack builds and publishes wheels with broad enough compatibility, how would that impact your evaluation of (the draft) PR #8?\r\n\r\nBesides adding wheels, we could implement a modular system for language support. However, that'd be a much larger undertaking and it's probably better to focus first on the immediate benefits of migrating to a maintained package with expanded language coverage, despite the increased size and build time.\r\n\r\n(For anyone curious, here are the [files for grantjenks's pack](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-languages/#files) on PyPI, including wheels, and here're its GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) and [build script](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/blob/main/build.py).)\r\n",

If it takes 4 minutes to pip install the tree-sitter-language-pack dependency, that's a lot to ask of users.\r\n\r\n@paul-gauthier Does adding pre-built wheels to tree-sitter-language-pack address your install time concerns?\r\n\r\n> 2. How often will the pip install fail when the wheel is being built on demand on the user's machine? I'm not sure what's involved in that step, but it feels like there is potential for problems given the diversity of end user build environments.\r\n\r\nThe user build failure rate would likely increase somewhat due to the larger number of grammar projects, but the extent is hard to predict. I suspect the increase would be small, as build environments are often generally broken rather than failing on specific projects. (Importantly, if the new pack's pre-built wheels cover the same targets as the old pack's, the fallback rate to source builds should be identical.)\r\n\r\nWith the unmaintained language pack's lack of ongoing support for newer systems, we should expect increases in both fallbacks to user builds and user build failures over time.\r\n\r\nA system for modular language packs could be ideal, e.g.:\r\n\r\n`pip install tree-sitter-language-pack[core,gleam,zig]`\r\n\r\nThis would install expected \"core\" languages plus Gleam and Zig. Other language grammars could be added without concern for bloat or risking breaking user builds. However, I'm less sure that the time and effort required for this modular approach is best way forward now.",

Perhaps your fast build used a locally cached previous build?\r\n\r\nGoldziher clearly did work to include pre-built wheels, as noted in the README and evidenced in a GitHub Actions workflow (5 months ago). I'm sure someone could dig in and finish what Goldziher started. Even if that work is trivial, there'd still be the matter of actually getting them published to PyPI, and maybe needing a separate fork.\r\n\r\nFor reference, `Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack` has a single [published file on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-language-pack/#files). Compare to [grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages) having [many wheels on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-languages/#files).\r\n\r\nTo avoid an uncontrolled dependency, I\u2019d lean towards Aider owning a modular tree-sitter language pack with prebuilt wheels under the Aider-AI org.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe explore bridging to another ecosystem in order to depend on something widely used and maintained, if such a thing exists at all. For example:\r\n\r\n- [universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) is very old, very stable, and actively maintained with daily commit activity. It also [has tons of languages, while missing many](https://gist.github.com/gohanlon/5153fa0f2b40438b5528acb83739a5eb) e.g., I noted that it's missing Swift, Zig, Mojo, and Gleam. To maintain a good `pip install` experience, we'd still need find or create Python bindings, tho.\r\n- [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/tree/main/vendor) has great [language coverage](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/tree/main/vendor). It's what GitHub uses it to detect languages and render them on the GitHub website itself. They have strict but reasonable rules about what languages are eligible for inclusion\u2014they can't support every upstart language (nor should Aider). I remember [Chris Lattner being rejected](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/pull/6400) when asking them to add Mojo (which did eventually meet the criteria and since been included). While Linguist is written in Ruby, [go-enry](https://github.com/go-enry/go-enry) is a Go port of Linguist that's automatically kept in sync with the upstream. They have worked on [Python bindings](https://github.com/src-d/enry/issues/154), but they are incomplete and not usable as is.",

I am trying to assess if folks have any problems installing this package, etc. Next steps will be do enable many more languages.\n\nI would appreciate feedback in both directions: let me know if this works or does not work for you.",

        "body": "Hi @paul-gauthier , thanks for your work on `aider`. I've been having a blast using it.\r\n\r\nThis project uses https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages, but that project is [unmaintained](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/issues/54) and has been for several months. This forces `grep-ast` to be stuck on an old tree-sitter version (0.21) and also limits the number of parsers that can be used by upstream projects (including aider). There is a [hacky way](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/issues/61#issuecomment-2105026544) to install new language parsers, but that dependency will seemingly be stuck on tree-sitter 0.21 indefinitely, which seems bad.\r\n\r\nAnother project has sprung up called [tree-sitter-language-pack](https://github.com/Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack), however it's got a slightly different intention (large collection of grammar binaries, as opposed to small/focused one for the most popular languages only).  That project is mainly an integration of this [unmerged tree-sitter-languages PR](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/pull/65) with a bunch of new grammar binaries added. There's probably space for a minimal version that bundles just the top N languages and natively allows users to install their own binaries at will (so, essentially, just a version of `tree-sitter-languages` with that PR merged, and some different grammar binaries).\r\n\r\nIf you want to replace `tree-sitter-languages` with `tree-sitter-language-pack`, I'd be happy to open a PR. Note that the source binary size is quite a bit larger:\r\n- `tree-sitter-language-pack`: 35.7 MB, no platform-specific builds\r\n- `tree-sitter-languages`: ~9.0MB, depending on the platform\r\n",

I don't know what the extensions of the other new languages are.\r\n\r\nI didn't see https://github.com/Aider-AI/grep-ast/pull/8 until just now so there's some amount of redundant effort here. Oops :) tree-sitter-languages-freed-wu-pr is a microfork I made based on https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/pull/53 . It does not change the API or build behavior, it just adds new languages (at least on Linux/MacOS, I couldn't get the Windows linker to work with the full list). This change is smaller, but #8 has more hope of support. So this is intended as a band-aid.",

Key changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Greatly increases the number of supported languages, including Swift and Svelte.\r\n2. Resolves dependency on an unmaintained package that was forcing grep-ast to use an old tree-sitter version (0.21).\r\n3. Unlocks the ability to use more recent tree-sitter versions.\r\n4. Updates requirements.txt to use tree-sitter-language-pack>=0.2.0.\r\n5. Increments the version number to 0.3.4-dev in setup.py.\r\n6. Adds extensive test cases for parsing various languages in test_parsers.py.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n- Removed support for DOT, OCaml, ql (GitHub CodeQL), and tsq (Tree Sitter Query) due to their absence in the new pack.\r\n- Removed potentially incorrect mappings for .gomod, .sqlite, and .regex extensions.\r\n- Replaced the uncommon \".et\" mapping for \"embeddedtemplate\" with mappings for ERB and EJS, which are common uses of embedded templates.\r\n- Re-enabled markdown as the new pack uses to a different markdown grammar that likely doesn't suffer from previous bugs.",

It is possible currently to get around the build issues for py-tree-sitter-languages by pinning `tree-sitter` to version 0.21.x and explicitly including distutils in the package. But having this whole tree depend on a maintained package would be better, overall, rather than requiring introduction of an abandoned package into a new tool. That workaround probably will not last forever, so it would be fantastic to have a version of grep-ast that did not require the older/abandoned dependencies.",

But most people who are consuming this outside of a `pip install` are going to use their system libraries. `py-tree-sitter-languages` is incompatible with `tree-sitter` 0.22+ which most Linux distributions have moved to because of its improved support for Python 3.12 and because it's the latest. And, since tree-sitter-languages is abandonware, it will not likely ever be updated. It would be better for anyone consuming this if an updated dependency was leveraged, instead. The issue isn't the transitive dep on tree-sitter itself. It's the dependency on tree-sitter-languages which has been abandoned and therefore doesn't support a pip install nor have good support in packaging distributions.",

For me, the size and build time, despite being substantial, aren't all that significant compared to the benefits. But, I'm sure we can (and should) do better:\r\n\r\n@Goldziher I see that the published files on [pypi.org/tree-sitter-language-pack](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-language-pack/#files) don't include any wheels, but that you've worked on some infrastructure to [build and publish](https://github.com/Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_and_publish.yaml) wheels. This seems like it'd be a non-trivial undertaking. Can you comment on the status/challenges of that work?\r\n\r\n@paul-gauthier If tree-sitter-language-pack builds and publishes wheels with broad enough compatibility, how would that impact your evaluation of (the draft) PR #8?\r\n\r\nBesides adding wheels, we could implement a modular system for language support. However, that'd be a much larger undertaking and it's probably better to focus first on the immediate benefits of migrating to a maintained package with expanded language coverage, despite the increased size and build time.\r\n\r\n(For anyone curious, here are the [files for grantjenks's pack](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-languages/#files) on PyPI, including wheels, and here're its GitHub Actions [workflow](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) and [build script](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/blob/main/build.py).)\r\n",

How often will the pip install fail when the wheel is being built on demand on the user's machine? I'm not sure what's involved in that step, but it feels like there is potential for problems given the diversity of end user build environments.\r\n\r\nThe user build failure rate would likely increase somewhat due to the larger number of grammar projects, but the extent is hard to predict. I suspect the increase would be small, as build environments are often generally broken rather than failing on specific projects. (Importantly, if the new pack's pre-built wheels cover the same targets as the old pack's, the fallback rate to source builds should be identical.)\r\n\r\nWith the unmaintained language pack's lack of ongoing support for newer systems, we should expect increases in both fallbacks to user builds and user build failures over time.\r\n\r\nA system for modular language packs could be ideal, e.g.:\r\n\r\n`pip install tree-sitter-language-pack[core,gleam,zig]`\r\n\r\nThis would install expected \"core\" languages plus Gleam and Zig. Other language grammars could be added without concern for bloat or risking breaking user builds. However, I'm less sure that the time and effort required for this modular approach is best way forward now.",

                "body": "@paul-gauthier Unfortunately, [Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack](https://github.com/Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack) does not have published wheels. Perhaps your fast build used a locally cached previous build?\r\n\r\nGoldziher clearly did work to include pre-built wheels, as noted in the README and evidenced in a GitHub Actions workflow (5 months ago). I'm sure someone could dig in and finish what Goldziher started. Even if that work is trivial, there'd still be the matter of actually getting them published to PyPI, and maybe needing a separate fork.\r\n\r\nFor reference, `Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack` has a single [published file on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-language-pack/#files). Compare to [grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages) having [many wheels on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tree-sitter-languages/#files).\r\n\r\nTo avoid an uncontrolled dependency, I\u2019d lean towards Aider owning a modular tree-sitter language pack with prebuilt wheels under the Aider-AI org.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe explore bridging to another ecosystem in order to depend on something widely used and maintained, if such a thing exists at all. For example:\r\n\r\n- [universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) is very old, very stable, and actively maintained with daily commit activity. It also [has tons of languages, while missing many](https://gist.github.com/gohanlon/5153fa0f2b40438b5528acb83739a5eb) e.g., I noted that it's missing Swift, Zig, Mojo, and Gleam. To maintain a good `pip install` experience, we'd still need find or create Python bindings, tho.\r\n- [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/tree/main/vendor) has great [language coverage](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/tree/main/vendor). It's what GitHub uses it to detect languages and render them on the GitHub website itself. They have strict but reasonable rules about what languages are eligible for inclusion\u2014they can't support every upstart language (nor should Aider). I remember [Chris Lattner being rejected](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/pull/6400) when asking them to add Mojo (which did eventually meet the criteria and since been included). While Linguist is written in Ruby, [go-enry](https://github.com/go-enry/go-enry) is a Go port of Linguist that's automatically kept in sync with the upstream. They have worked on [Python bindings](https://github.com/src-d/enry/issues/154), but they are incomplete and not usable as is.",

I am trying to assess if folks have any problems installing this package, etc. Next steps will be do enable many more languages.\n\nI would appreciate feedback in both directions: let me know if this works or does not work for you.",

Thanks @paul-gauthier for the experimental release -- it successfully fixes the hang I was experiencing with typescript.\n\nThere's a bug with the treesitter version that the main release of Aider/grep-ast was using. I ended up adjusting grep-ast to use the new language pack + pyproject, which also fixed the issue. The uv install time is more-or-less identical for both; I find the pip install exhaustingly slow no matter what...",

        "body": "Hi @paul-gauthier , thanks for your work on `aider`. I've been having a blast using it.\r\n\r\nThis project uses https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages, but that project is [unmaintained](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/issues/54) and has been for several months. This forces `grep-ast` to be stuck on an old tree-sitter version (0.21) and also limits the number of parsers that can be used by upstream projects (including aider). There is a [hacky way](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/issues/61#issuecomment-2105026544) to install new language parsers, but that dependency will seemingly be stuck on tree-sitter 0.21 indefinitely, which seems bad.\r\n\r\nAnother project has sprung up called [tree-sitter-language-pack](https://github.com/Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack), however it's got a slightly different intention (large collection of grammar binaries, as opposed to small/focused one for the most popular languages only).  That project is mainly an integration of this [unmerged tree-sitter-languages PR](https://github.com/grantjenks/py-tree-sitter-languages/pull/65) with a bunch of new grammar binaries added. There's probably space for a minimal version that bundles just the top N languages and natively allows users to install their own binaries at will (so, essentially, just a version of `tree-sitter-languages` with that PR merged, and some different grammar binaries).\r\n\r\nIf you want to replace `tree-sitter-languages` with `tree-sitter-language-pack`, I'd be happy to open a PR. Note that the source binary size is quite a bit larger:\r\n- `tree-sitter-language-pack`: 35.7 MB, no platform-specific builds\r\n- `tree-sitter-languages`: ~9.0MB, depending on the platform\r\n",
