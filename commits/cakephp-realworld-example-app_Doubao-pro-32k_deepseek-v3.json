By introducing the 'tree-sitter-language-pack' dependency and removing the older 'tree-sitter-languages' dependency, the software gains the ability to support a new programming language while optimizing its language support capabilities. This update likely improves software efficiency and allows for more targeted language expansions in the future, enhancing the user experience and potentially leading to better performance."
