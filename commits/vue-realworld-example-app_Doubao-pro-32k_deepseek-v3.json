The new method dynamically determines the lines to display based on the content, ensuring every 30th line is included and always including the first and last lines. If there are fewer than 30 lines, the middle line is included. This change enhances the display of lines in the TreeContext by making it more adaptive and representative of the content, improving readability and reducing clutter. The removal of the fixed steps logic simplifies the code and aligns it with the new dynamic approach."
